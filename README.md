Welcome to the G2 coding challenge!

To run this app, first open "g2backend" by running 'rails s'.

Next, open "g2frontend" with 'yarn start'.  

It will prompt you to run the app on a different server, as the localhost is being utilized by the backend.   Simply respond 'yes' and navigate to /roster.

There you should find a list of G2 company members along with title, bio, a picture, and a voting button.  

These apps were created with a Ruby on Rails backend and a React-Redux frontend.   Thanks for checking it out!
